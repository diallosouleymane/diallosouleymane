### 🧠 About Me

I'm a software engineer from Côte d’Ivoire with a strong drive for building pragmatic, scalable, and elegant systems.  
I focus on crafting seamless developer experiences, performant backends, and polished frontend applications.

> “Code is not just a tool, it’s a voice — and I use mine to build what matters.”

- 💡 Strong focus: API design · Web performance · DevOps · Auth systems · Clean architecture  
- 🛠️ Tools I love: **TypeScript, ElysiaJS, NestJS, PostgreSQL, Prisma, FastAPI, Go, Docker**
- 🔐 I care about security, maintainability, and DX (Developer Experience)

### 🧩 What I Believe In

- Open-source is a mindset, not just a license.  
- The best code is the one you never have to write twice.  
- Africa needs more builders — and I’m here for that.
